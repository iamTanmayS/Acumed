Acumed
A Secure, AI-Powered, Immersive Healthcare Platform

🩺 1. Problem Statement
Fragmented Health Records: Patients and doctors lack a unified, trustworthy source of health data.

Limited Control & Security: Sensitive medical records are vulnerable and difficult to share securely.

Slow Diagnostics: Access to medical experts and diagnosis tools is limited, especially in rural areas.

Lack of Immersive Tools: Doctors often rely on 2D records without visual or interactive aids.

Poor Accessibility: Patients face language and tech barriers in understanding their conditions.
